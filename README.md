# MyNotes
Just a repo where I add some notes or create reference sheets based on tutorials or documentations I have gone through. 
Do note that this is not an effective learning tool but rather a bunch of reference notes I created for myself so there might be information added in a haphazard manner or with poor formatting/syntax.
Hoping to update everyday!
